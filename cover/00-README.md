# Notes

1. The book is 6inx9in, it has a 2:3 ratio, i.e. 0.666

2. The standard (ideal according to KDP) cover for EPUB is 1.6:1 height/width, i.e.:
   1600x2560 or 0.625
   
3. There would be some stretching if the 0.625 is put as cover in a PDF file and
   background art will not cover everything in the PDF cover for a print book
   
4. The following steps are therefore followed

   - The work is done in the 1706x2560 PPTX, where the ratio is 0.666, but uses the same
     height as the 1600x2560 file (ratio 0.625)
     
   - This can be used directly for the PDF cover
   
   - If the 1600x2560 files are needed, things can be put in the 1600x2560 pptx, with
     artwork being re-fit or simply cut using the guidelines from the 1706x2560 pptx
 
 The file cover-pages-old.pptx is an old version where the pages are not dimensioned for
 anything, but the content is dimensioned for 1.6:1 (except for 1pixel when pasting as an
 image somewhere else) It is kept for historical purposes
 
 **Note**: save pages as PNG from the PPTX to get the right dimensions directly.
